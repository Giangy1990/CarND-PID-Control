# CarND-Controls-PID
This repository contains all the code needed to complete the final project for the Control course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

## Project Introduction
The car has a system able to provide the tracking error of the vehicle with respect to the center of the track. The purpose of this module is the implementation of a PID used to control the steer command and minimize the error.

## PID controller
The PID controller combines the effect of three control law to minimize the error between the reference and the feedback of the system. in particular, the contribution are:
* **P** (proportional): it establishes the linear relationship with the problem. It depends by the value of error at the current time step.\
      up = -Kp * e
* **I** (integral): it establishes linear relationship between the average value of problem over time. It depends by all the story of the error from the beginning of time to the current time step.\
      ui = -Ki * âˆ‘ e
* **D** (derivative): it establishes linear relationship with the rate of change of problem. It depends by the variation of the error between the previous and the current time step.\
      ud = -Kd * d(e)/dt

The final control signal is given by the sum of the three contributions.

## Project implementation
The controller is defined in the file [PID.h](./src/PID.h) and implemented in the file [PID.cpp](./src/PID.cpp).
To use the controller, there are two functions that must be called in sequence:
1. ***UpdateError(cte)***: this function updates the three errors of the PID and calls a private function ***twiddle()*** that performs the fine tuning of the gains.
2. ***TotalError()***: this function returns the control value according to the errors and the gains.

## Tuning
The PID controller has been tuned through two steps:
1. the Ziegler-Nichols method to have a first set of gains;
2. 30 minutes of Twiddle method to fine tune the gain.

In this [video](./media/PID.mp4) it is possible to see the car that drives on the track.

## Conclusions
The PID controller is sufficient to drive a vehicle through the track.
The set of gains used in this project can be improved using a different initial set for the twiddle and increasing the time period of the twiddle algorithm to have a better mean over the track and so perform a better optimization of the PID gains.
